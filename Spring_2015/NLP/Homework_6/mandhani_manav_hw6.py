# Problem 1
a) act or be so as to become in a specified state
b) have left or have as a remainder
c) go forth, go away : go away from a place
d) exit#1, go out#1, get out#1, leave#5 (move out of or depart from)
e) allow for#1, allow#5, provide#5 (make a possibility or provide opportunity for; permit to be attainable or cause to remain)
f) have left or have as a remainder
g) result#2, lead#2 (produce as a result or residue)
h) have left or have as a remainder
i) act or be so as to become in a specified state
j) act or be so as to become in a specified state

• Which sentences were hard to annotate, and why?

b, g, e and i were difficult to distinguish as the context did not provide enough information to make a sure decision. 
The wordnet senses were too similar to each other and it would've helped if there was more context to describe what wordsense of "left" or "leave" had to be used

• Which pairs (or groups) of WordNet senses did you find hard to
distinguish, and what criteria did you use to distinguish between
them?

(leave#7,leave#12) was a confusing pair since it has ambiguous use of "result" and "allow for", (leave#5, leave#1) also had ambiguous use of "go forth" and "exit". 


# Problem 2

a) P(Removing) = (No.of removing)/(No.of elements in set) = 2/16 = 1/8

b) P(Day|Reading) = P(Reading|Day)*P(Day)/P(Reading) = ((3/6)*(6/16))/(8/16) = 3/8 = 0.375

c) With Reading, Prob = P(Reading) * P(paper|Reading) * P(surface|Reading) * P(towards|Reading) = (8/16) * (4/8) * 0 * 0 = 0

With Removing, Prob = P(Removing) * P(paper|Removing) * P(surface|Removing) * P(towards|Removing) = (2/16) * (1/2) * (1/2) * 0 = 0

With Self_motion, Prob = P(Self_motion) * P(paper|Self_motion) * P(surface|Self_motion) * P(towards|Self_motion) = (6/16) * (1/6) * (2/6) * (1/6) = 1/288 = 0.0034722
